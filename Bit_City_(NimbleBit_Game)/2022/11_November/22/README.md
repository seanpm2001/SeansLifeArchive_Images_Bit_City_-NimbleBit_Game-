<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older lead entries.</p></summary>

I had a medium length Bit City session today, playing the game at a slow relaxing rate before I wrapped up and quit. I played casually and got less rapid screenshots than last week. I am focusing now on upgrading buildings, gaining bux, and maxing out upgrades, since I reached a city population of MAX 1.11 Million on 2021 Tuesday September 14th. I have maxed out city 8. I am told there is no city 9, but I feel that there is now. I am still not going to move on until I progress a lot more, basically when all buildings require at least 3 seconds to upgrade.

Progress was very pleasant today, I quit, as I didn't want to spend more time playing. - 2021 October 19th

## Plans for the next Bit City

When I prestige, and make it back to city 8 (bit city) I have some ideas:

> Industrial city

All buildings are towers (except for the bank, town hall, and dealerships)

> Green city

All buildings are greenery (ponds, forests, shrubs, and other plants) (except for the bank, town hall, and dealerships)

## Plans for return

I considered returning gameplay today during a car trip, but decided to just enjoy the trip instead. I wouldn't be able to use the double time boost anyways, due to no Internet connection. I am likely to come back after I finish this programming language acceleration project. It is coming very close to the finish point. - 2022, Tuesday, November 1st
