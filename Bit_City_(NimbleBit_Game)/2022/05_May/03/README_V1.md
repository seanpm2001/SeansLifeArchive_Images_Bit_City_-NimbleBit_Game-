# Bit City session 2022 May 3rd

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older lead entries.</p></summary>

I had a medium length Bit City session today, playing the game at a slow relaxing rate before I wrapped up and quit. I played casually and got less rapid screenshots than last week. I am focusing now on upgrading buildings, gaining bux, and maxing out upgrades, since I reached a city population of MAX 1.11 Million on 2021 Tuesday September 14th. I have maxed out city 8. I am told there is no city 9, but I feel that there is now. I am still not going to move on until I progress a lot more, basically when all buildings require at least 3 seconds to upgrade.

Progress was very pleasant today, I quit, as I didn't want to spend more time playing. - 2021 October 19th
