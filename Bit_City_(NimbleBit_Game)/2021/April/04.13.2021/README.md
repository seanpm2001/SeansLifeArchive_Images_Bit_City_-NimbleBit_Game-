# Bit City session April 13th 2021

I had a very long Bit City session and made lots of progress. Today I took the step of advancing to city 8 (8 bit, bit city) and I spent time trying to catch up on some progress there.

## Ads

I used ads a few times today, but limited my reliance on them. Playing ads also gives me uninterrupted time to go and write notes, among other things.

## City upgrade

I advanced from city 7 to city 8 today. City 8 is called "Bit City" I intend to make as much progress here and get prestige upgrades before doing a prestige. 1 main goal is to be able to reset with at least 1300 additional keys (at least 100x the current amount i have (13))

## Building

I did thousands of construction projects today.

## Quests

I completed a few quests today, including the quest to do 10000 construction projects, which took me several weeks.

## Distractions

I spent a lot of time sorting files on my secondary laptop while playing today, so times are off pretty frequently. I also went outside, and did other things as well. I played less than 90% of the time.

## Overview

See above.
