# Bit City session April 6th 2021

I had a shorter Bit City session today in preparation of my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session. I made some progress today, and decided to quit early.

## Quadrillionaire

I am close to becoming a quadrillinonaire in this game. I made lots of progress towards this today, but I decided to save the rest for next Tuesday.

## Special buildings

I am now buying more special buildings due to their potential. I spent 1200 bux on 4 new special buildings today.

## Ad boost

I am working on relying less and less on ad boosts, and still making a profit. I didn't keep the 2x boost on for the majority of my session today.

## Overview

See the top section.
