# Bit City session April 27th 2021

I had a very long Bit CIty session today and had a good time.

## Upgrades

I did not do any upgrades today.

## Building

I constructed dozens of buildings today, and made a lot of progress here. I am up to a population of 600000 now.

## Cars

I bought 1 set of 8 cars today to increase production.

## Bank

I upgraded the bakl

## Double time

I used the double time boost at least 3 times today to make gameplay a bit faster.

## Play duration

I played for over 2 hours today, and played a bit while outside. I took some breaks to do other things as well, so it wasn't constant and 2+ hours straight.
