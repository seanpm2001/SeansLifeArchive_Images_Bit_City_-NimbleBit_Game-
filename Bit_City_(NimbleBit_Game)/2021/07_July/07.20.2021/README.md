# Bit City session July 20th 2021

I had a short Bit City session today, playing the game at a slow relaxing rate before I wrapped up and quit. I reached a city population of 914,000 today.

## Upgrades

I didn't do any upgrades today.

### Common upgrades

I didn't do any common upgrades today, as none were available.

### Epic upgrades

<!-- I bought a second "keeper of keys" upgrade today. I hope to max this out before pulling a prestige. !-->

I didn't do any epic upgrades today, as it will take me a long time to save up to do my planned next one (Keeper of Keys III)

## Building

I constructed several new buildings today, and made a bit of progress here. I am up to a population of 914,000 today.

## Cars

I did not buy any new cars today.

## Boats

I did not buy any boats today, as I have already unlocked all of them in the current city.

## Airport

I did not buy air vehicles boats today, as I have already unlocked all of them in the current city.

## Double time

I used the double time boost 1 time today to make gameplay a bit faster, and didn't go without it today.
