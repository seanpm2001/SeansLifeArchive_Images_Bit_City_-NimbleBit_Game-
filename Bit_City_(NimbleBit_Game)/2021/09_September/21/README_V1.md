# Bit City session 2021 September 21st

I had a very long Bit City session today, playing the game at a slow relaxing rate before I wrapped up and quit. I played casually and got rapid screenshots. I am focusing now on upgrading buildings and maxing out upgrades, since I reached a city population of MAX 1.11 Million on 2021 Tuesday September 14th. I have maxed out city 8. I am told there is no city 9, but I feel that there is now. I am still not going to move on until I progress a lot more, basically when all buildings require at least 3 seconds to upgrade.

## Upgrades

I didn't do any upgrades today.

### Common upgrades

I didn't do any common upgrades today, as none were available.

### Epic upgrades

<!-- I bought a second "keeper of keys" upgrade today. I hope to max this out before pulling a prestige. !-->

I didn't do any epic upgrades today, as it will take me a long time to save up to do my planned next one (Keeper of Keys III) I came really close to it, but I had other things to do today, so I quit.

## Building

I constructed many new buildings today, and made a lot of progress here. I currently have a population of 1.11 million.

## Cars

I bought 1 new car today.

## Boats

I did not buy any boats today, as I have already unlocked all of them in the current city.

## Airport

I did not buy air vehicles boats today, as I have already unlocked all of them in the current city.

## Double time

I used the double time boost at least 4 times today to make gameplay a bit faster, and didn't go without it today.

## Play duration

I played for over 60 minutes today.

## Bank

I upgraded my bank to get more away earnings today. The upgrade costs 1 quadrillion dollars.

## Overview

See above.
