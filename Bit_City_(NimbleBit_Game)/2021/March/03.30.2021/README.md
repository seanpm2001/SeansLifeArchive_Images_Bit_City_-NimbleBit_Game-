# Bit City session March 30th 2021

I had a long session today. I made some progress, but didn't achieve too much

## Quests

I made over 1000 upgrades and made progress towards a quest for 10000 upgrades that I have been working on for a few weeks.

## Ad issues

The game has been having ad issues today. It hasn't done this in the past. I need to get used to playing the game at normal speed, and not watch ads anyways.

## Upgrades

I did 1 perma-upgrade today, and tried to save up for the last upgrade that costs less than 1000 bux, but I quit earlier, so I didn't reach that goal.

## Earnings

My earnings per second went up significantly today. I am working on saving up 1 quadrillion dollars for looks (to see x quadrillion, instead of x trillion) and a bank upgrade.
