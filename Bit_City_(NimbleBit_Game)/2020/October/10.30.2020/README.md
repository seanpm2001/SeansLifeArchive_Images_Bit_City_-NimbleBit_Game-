# October 30th 2020 - Didn't play

I didn't play Bit City today. I took a break from it, as I didn't have the time. I wanted to play today, but I didn't have the time.

Due to a discovery on October 24th 2020 about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Tuesday. I will be playing again on Tuesday, November 3rd 2020.
