## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Bit_City_-NimbleBit_Game-/wiki)

See above. This repository hosts all weekly Bit City session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.bitcity&hl=en&gl=US) there is a version available for iOS. It is listed below

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Bit City in mid 2020 during my NimbleBit fan phase. I continue to play on a weekly basis. I am doing extra and designing the city, instead of just trying to reach requirements.
